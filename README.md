Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

I chose to upload my Thermostat project.  By utilizing all the techniques taught in this class I built a thermostat with a timer that could connect to the cloud.  I also had buttons that could turn the temperature up or down depending on the button pressed.  This project used most of the drivers that we had learned in the class, such as GPIO, UART, 12C and the timer.

What did you do particularly well?

I think that I coded my task schedular really well.  The buttons also worked as intended.

Where could you improve?

I think that this project went particularly well, however, I could of probably wrote less code and got the same functionality.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

I learned the C language, embedded systems, state machines and different drivers and protocols.  I invested a lot of time researching documentation.  I think that all the research and learning a complete new way of programming will help me in my career and in the remainder of my course work?

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The task schedular can be reused to do different things.  I had to comment to keep this maintainable as there were many different things going on at once.
